You've landed on the right place ...
 
* This is an an Add-In for LibreOffice and OpenOffice. It only works in Calc (a new function is made available).

* It adds a totally useless but [missing function since OpenOffice 3.4](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Easter_Eggs).

* It allows to get [the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) seamlessly from Calc in any cell or formula.

* If the question is correctly put, you will get the answer. If the question is not understandable, you will surely get some infinite improbability.

## Installation

Simply download the extension (`.oxt`) from [releases](https://github.com/tudstlennkozh/dontpanic/releases/latest) and install it under LibreOffice.

## Usage

How to call it :

Inside a cell or a formula (only with Calc), the function to call is `ANSWER` (if your locale is english). Some other locales exist (german, french).
